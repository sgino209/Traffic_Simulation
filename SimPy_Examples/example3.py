# This example demonstrates process interaction scheme with interrupts.

# Example model:  an electric car can be charged when parking, and may drive only when charging is completed
#                 This time (comparing to example2) we donâ€™t want to wait until the electric vehicle is fully charged,
#                 but want to interrupt the charging process and just start driving instead.

# Additional information for SimPy is available at:
# (-) http://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/simpy_intro/process_interaction.html
